**TL;DR**: Lexa, she/they, french CS student, nerd

Hello :) my name is Clarisse, but people commonly call me Lexa (you might also see an alternative spelling, Lexhā). You can use `she` or `they` pronouns to refer to me, though I don't mind any other ones.
I am a student in computer science speaking French and English, currently learning Korean.

## Programming languages

In alphabetical order, the languages I know at least a little bit, and write code in.

- C
- OCaml
- Python
- Rust
- TypeScript

Special mention: languages which I sometimes write in, but rarely/never make full programs.

- C++
- Haskell
- Uiua

Strict typing enthousiast, btw :)

## Interests

My interests are directed towards **analysis** and **language design & implementation**. I am also a terminal (and its emulation) enthousiast, more specifically **enjoying writing pretty CLIs** for programs, jumping between ANSI sequences.

I crave learning in depth about **category theory** ; while not knowing much about it yet, I love **experimenting with abstractions**, sometimes reinventing the wheel... but that's the best way for me, as well as by teaching to myself, to gain knowledge.

Outside of computer science and mathematics, I am a curious cat excited by many other areas. Most notable ones include: linguistics, music and graphic design.

## Projects

The stuff I made that might interest you.

- [kalmia](https://github.com/qexat/kalmia-theme/), a Visual Studio Code theme extension: pretty muted colors and a dimmed rose background. A high contrast variant is also available.
- [anstrip](https://github.com/qexat/anstrip), a minimal Python package to strip (conditionally or not) ANSI escape sequences.
- [coquille](https://github.com/qexat/Coquille), a rather low-level Python package that provides a friendlier interface to escape sequences to avoid hardcoding them in your string literals.

Hopefully more to come!

## Q/A

### How does one pronounce "qexat"?

It is pronounced "kegzat", including the ending "t".

### Why do you have several names?

Lexa is my nickname. It is merging my names, and is usually easier for people to pronounce. Regarding the alternative spelling (and pronounciation), it has to do with a conlang I am currently making!

### What is your favorite programming language?

The language that I will make in a few years 😄

### What is a monad?

Let $X$ be a category. A monad on $X$ is a functor $F : X \rightarrow X$ equipped with two natural transformations $a : id_X \rightarrow F$ and $b : F ∘ F \rightarrow F$ such that $b ∘ F b = b ∘ b F$ (associativity) and $b ∘ F a = b ∘ a F = id_F$ (identity). No, it is not a monoid, unless you stretch the definition of the latter a lot.

### Do you listen to K-pop?

Not just k-pop, but yes! A non-exhaustive list of my favorite groups: Dreamcatcher, Purple Kiss, Pixy, æspa, ATEEZ, Stray Kids.
