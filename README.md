Hello :)

My name is Clarisse, but people commonly call me Lexa (you might also see an alternative spelling, Lexhā). You can use `she` or `they` pronouns to refer to me.
I am a student in computer science speaking French and English, currently learning Korean. I like abstract mathematics, linguistics, music and graphic design.

```ocaml
let main : IO
    io => io.stdout <- writeln "Hello, I am Lexa!"
```
