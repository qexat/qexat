Hello :)

My name is Clarisse, but people commonly call me Lexa (you might also see an alternative spelling, LexhƒÅ). You can use `she` or `they` pronouns to refer to me.
I am a student in computer science speaking French and English. I like abstract mathematics, linguistics, music and graphic design.

```ocaml
let () = IO.print_line $"Hello, I am Lexa!"
```
